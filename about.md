<div class="about">
  <p>Hi, I'm Pankaj Sharma—a data scientist based in New York City focused on shipping production-grade models, uplift measurement, and experimentation strategy.</p>
  <p>I pair statistical learning with clear storytelling to help product and marketing teams make better decisions. Most days you'll find me prototyping pipelines in Python, shaping causal analyses, or refining dashboards for non-technical partners.</p>
  <p>Previously I've delivered uplift modeling systems, experimentation guidance, and revenue analytics across retail and ecommerce. I hold an MS in Statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a BTech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.</p>
