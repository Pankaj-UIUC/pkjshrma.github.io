Thanks for stopping by! I'm excited to share this space with you. Whether you found your way here through a mutual connection, a search for data science insights, or pure curiosity, I'm glad you're here.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Pankaj Sharma—a New York City-based data scientist with more than five years of experience translating statistical learning into decisions for marketing, operations, and customer experience teams. My toolkit spans Python, SQL, Spark, and AWS services, and I enjoy combining experimentation, probabilistic modeling, and storytelling to move ideas from prototype to production.

In my current role I build the analytical engines that connect omni-channel marketing signals to business outcomes. That has meant productizing predictive models that feed media mix optimization, shipping self-serve tools that let marketers explore conversion-path scenarios, and partnering with product teams to refine digital journeys for both shoppers and non-shoppers. Earlier in my career I supported experimentation and revenue analytics initiatives—standing up uplift modeling pipelines, shaping test-and-learn strategies, and guiding stakeholders through causal inference best practices.

I earned an MS in Statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a BTech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. When I'm not prototyping models, you can usually find me building visual analytics in Tableau or Matplotlib, digging into new research on machine learning for decision-making, or sharing what I've learned with other data practitioners.

## What to Expect

This blog is where I'll share insights, lessons learned, and thoughts on data science, causal inference, and the craft of analytics. I believe in learning by doing and sharing what I discover along the way. Whether it's a deep dive into statistical methods, reflections on building data products, or practical tips from the trenches—I hope you find something useful here.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to connecting with you!
